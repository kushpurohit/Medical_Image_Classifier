## Project Description
This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify scientific images. A dataset of 10,000 images was processed and models such as CNN, ResNet, and EfficientNet were implemented to achieve high classification accuracy. The primary challenge faced was balancing the dataset and optimizing model performance to avoid overfitting. Data preprocessing involved image transformations like resizing and normalization.

## Needs of this project
- Deep learning model tuning
- Data processing/augmentation
- Performance evaluation and reporting
